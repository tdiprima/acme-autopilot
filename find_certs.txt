📂 All files containing '<URL>':
/root/.acme.sh/<URL>_ecc/<URL>.csr
/root/.acme.sh/<URL>_ecc/<URL>.csr.conf
/root/.acme.sh/<URL>_ecc/<URL>.conf

🔧 What you need for your web server:
=====================================
For NGINX, you typically need:
   ssl_certificate      /path/to/fullchain.pem;
   ssl_certificate_key  /path/to/private.key;

For Apache, you typically need:
   SSLCertificateFile    /path/to/cert.pem
   SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/private.key
   SSLCertificateChainFile /path/to/fullchain.pem

🎯 Next steps:
1. Identify which files exist from the list above
2. Use the paths in your web server configuration
3. Test with: nginx -t (for nginx) or apache2ctl configtest (for apache)
